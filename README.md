# Project description
This repository is dedicated to building digital filter from mathematical model in **_MatLab Simulink_** to RTL and then to ASIC (IP-core) topology with **_Cadence_** tools such as **_RTL-Compiler_**, **_Encounter_** and **_Viruoso_** for final sign-off verification.
The filter is a passband IIR-filter with x3 parallelization for higher operating sample frequency.

Filter characteristics are as follows (_f~s~_ - sample frequency):
<table>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>Frequency, <i>f<sub>s</sub></i></td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Attenuation, dB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Passband center</td>
        <td>0.15</td>
        <td>Stopband attenuation</td>
        <td>65</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Passband center</td>
        <td>0.25</td>
        <td>Passband ripple</td>
        <td>0.25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Transition bands</td>
        <td>0.05</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Input/Output bit depth = 11 bits.

Synthesis constraints:
Target sample frequency = 20 MHz, clock uncertanty (jitter) = 10%.

Filter's coefficients are calculated with **_MatLab's Filter Designer_** utility (fdatool). <br>
The resulting filter is 12-th order elliptic filter. <br>
Input samples are in fixed point representation so as arithmetics inside filter. <br>
Every arithmetic block's output bit depth was minimized to to such an extent that the output of fixed point filter model had a maximum error from refence model of no more then 0.5 LSBs.    

# Project Results
Filter's HDL-description is written in SystemVerilog, top-level architecture of this DSP-block is shown below.
![RTL Architecture](README_Images/RTL_Architecture.png)
(_fs_ and _fs/3_ denotes sample rates at different stages of a design.)

Testing filter with chirp-like input signal results in desired frequency response.

Here is an image of a layout from Encounter with rulers.
![Layout in Encounter](/README_Images/Encounter_Layout.png)
Resulting filter has been synthesized, dimensions are 1290 $`\mu`$m by 890 $`\mu`$m, and total area is 1.1 $mm^{2}$. Final —Åore utilization is around 60-70%. <br>

# This directory contains two subdirectories:
* **_/RTL_**,
* **_/Simulink_**.

## _/RTL_
First one contains everything related to rtl: final version of filter rtl-description, everything related to design synthesis (logical and physical).

## _/Simulink_
Second subdirectory contains Simulink model files, result of HDL conversion by HDL Coder and a script for reference data generation for RTL-simulation.

Go to dedicated README's to find files descriptions and instructions on how to build project.
